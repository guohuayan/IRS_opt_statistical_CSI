## IRS opt statistical CSI

This repository contains the source codes of the paper ``Intelligent Reflecting Surface Configuration With Historical Channel Observations'' published in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.


The main motivation of this work is that in existing works, the IRS configuration with statistical CSI is actually only based on the LoS-link CSI, and the spatial correlation of the NLoS channel is ignored. This kind of algorithm is suboptimal and may perform poorly when the channel gain of the LoS-link is small. 

In this paper, we propose a general IRS statistical CSI configuration algorithm. The statistical CSI is directly learnt from the historical channel observations. Our algorithm can be adopted to any statistical CSI model even for the case when there is no LoS link between BS and IRS.
